    Creates a .zip file named `model_name`.zip in the specified `out_dir`, and a
    directory inside of this file named `model_name`. The MJCF XML is written into
    this directory with the name `model_name`.xml, and all the assets are also
    written into this directory without changing their names.

    Args:
      mjcf_model: `mjcf.RootElement` instance to export.
      out_dir: Directory to save the .zip file. Will be created if it does not
        already exist.
      model_name: (Optional) Name of the .zip file, the name of the directory
        inside the .zip root containing the model and assets, and name of the XML
        file inside this directory. Defaults to the MJCF model name
        (`mjcf_model.model`).
      precision: (optional) Number of digits to output for floating point
        quantities.
      zero_threshold: (optional) When outputting XML, floating point quantities
        whose absolute value falls below this threshold will be treated as zero.
