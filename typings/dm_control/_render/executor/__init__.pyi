"""RenderExecutor executes OpenGL rendering calls on an appropriate thread.

OpenGL calls must be made on the same thread as where an OpenGL context is
made current on. With GPU rendering, migrating OpenGL contexts between threads
can become expensive. We provide a thread-safe executor that maintains a
thread on which an OpenGL context can be kept permanently current, and any other
threads that wish to render with that context will have their rendering calls
offloaded to the dedicated thread.

For single-threaded applications, set the `DISABLE_RENDER_THREAD_OFFLOADING`
environment variable before launching the Python interpreter. This will
eliminate the overhead of unnecessary thread-switching.
