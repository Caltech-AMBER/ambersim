def load_dict(data, **kwargs):  # -> dict[Unknown, Unknown]:
    """
    Load multiple input types into kwargs for a Trimesh constructor.
    Tries to extract keys:
    'faces'
    'vertices'
    'face_normals'
    'vertex_normals'

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : dict
    accepts multiple forms
          -dict: has keys for vertices and faces as (n,3) numpy arrays
          -dict: has keys for vertices/faces (n,3) arrays encoded as dicts/base64
                 with trimesh.util.array_to_encoded/trimesh.util.encoded_to_array
          -str:  json blob as dict with either straight array or base64 values
          -file object: json blob of dict
    file_type: not used
