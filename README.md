# AMBER Simulation Tools
This repository houses tools built on the GPU-accelerated simulation capabilities of MuJoCo 3. The goal is to act as a centralized location for
* common robot models shared across the lab,
* shared interfaces for control architectures, and
* massively-parallelized simulation.

## Installation
### Local
Clone this repository and run the following commands in the repository root to create and activate a conda environment with Cuda 11.8 support:
```
conda env create -n <env_name> -f environment.yml
conda activate <env_name>
```

TL;DR: installation commands are here. This will ask you for your password to install system-wide dependencies. For details, see below.

For non-developers installing `mujoco` from source, run the following in the repo root:
```
./ambersim/_scripts/install.sh -s
```

For developers installing `mujoco` from source:
```
# no path to the mujoco repo specified
./ambersim/_scripts/install.sh -s -d

# specifying a path to the mujoco repo
./ambersim/_scripts/install.sh -s -d --mujoco-dir /path/ending/in/mujoco
```

Installation of this package is done via the above `bash` script. There are a few flags for configuring the installation:
* `-d` controls whether to use the heavier _development_ dependencies, which include linting and testing dependencies;
* `-s` controls whether to install the most recent `mujoco` version from source. We recommend doing this, since the development version usually has important bugfixes.
* `--disable-apt` specifies whether to disable the system-wide dependencies installed by `apt`. This is enabled by default. The packages are:
    * `libgl1-mesa-dev`
    * `libxinerama-dev`
    * `libxcursor-dev`
    * `libxrandr-dev`
    * `libxi-dev`
    * `ninja-build`
* `--mujoco-dir` specifies the directory of the local `mujoco` repo, which must end in the directory `mujoco`. If the supplied directory doesn't exist, it will be created and `mujoco` will be installed there. If `mujoco-dir` is not specified, then it will be cloned and installed into `$HOME/mujoco`. We recommend pointing this to a reasonable location instead of using the default.

If the following line of code runs without error, then the installation of `mujoco` from source was successful:
```
python -c "import mujoco; from mujoco import mjx"
```
Further, you can examine the latest minor version using `pip`:
```
pip show mujoco
pip show mujoco-mjx
```

### Via `pip`
There's currently no official pypi release, but you can still install this package via `pip`. We recommend installing it in a conda environment with Cuda 11.8 support.
```
# all development dependencies
pip install "ambersim[all] @ git+https://github.com/Caltech-AMBER/ambersim.git" --find-links https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html

# barebones dependencies
pip install "ambersim @ git+https://github.com/Caltech-AMBER/ambersim.git" --find-links https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```
This package also installs a script that can help you optionally build and install `mujoco` from source to get the latest and greatest features and bugfixes between official releases.
```
install-mujoco-from-src [--hash <mujoco_commit_hash>] [--mujoco-dir /path/to/local/mujoco]
```
Both `--hash` and `--mujoco-dir` are optional arguments. If no hash is supplied, we pull the latest one. If no `mujoco` directory is supplied, we clone `mujoco` into `$HOME/mujoco`. We recommend pointing this to a reasonable location instead of using the default.

In order to build `mujoco` successfully, you may need to install system-wide dependencies with the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    libgl1-mesa-dev \
    libxinerama-dev \
    libxcursor-dev \
    libxrandr-dev \
    libxi-dev \
    ninja-build
```

## Custom Models
We have implemented some custom utils for model parsing, but they aren't complete/perfect. Here are some guidelines for when you want to use this codebase for a custom project:
* it's OK to just use URDFs and use our utils for loading them into `mjx` if you don't care too much about collision filtering or mujoco-specific elements like lights, sites, etc.
* if you decide to use URDFs instead of converting the model description into an `xml`, then you should add a `<mujoco>` tag with some specific settings to the top of your URDF. See the examples in this repo as guidance.
	* you should also make sure that your actuated joints have `<transmission>` blocks associated with them, as this is what our parser looks for to add actuators to the mujoco model.
* if you decide to convert the URDF to an XML, then we have some custom utils for helping with the initial conversion, but if you want to add a lot of mujoco-specific elements, those need to be done by hand.

## Development Details

### Abridged Dev Guidelines
Development on this code will be controlled via code review. To facilitate this, please follow these guidelines:
* keep your pull requests small so that it's practical to human review them;
* try to create _draft pull requests_ instead of regular ones and request reviews from relevant people only when ready - we rebuild `mujoco` from source when this happens;
* write tests as you go (and if you are reviewing, suggest missing tests);
* write docstrings for public classes and methods, even if it's just a one-liner;
* before committing, make sure you locally pass all tests by running `pytest` in the repo root;
* pass static type checking by running `pyright` in the repo root before committing;
* when typing, use conventions compatible with `python3.8`, e.g., instead of typing with `tuple[obj1, obj2]`, use `from typing import Tuple; ... Tuple[obj1, obj2]` and so on.

### Dependencies
Python dependencies are specified using a `pyproject.toml` file. Non-python dependencies are specified using the `environment.yml` file, which can create a compliant `conda` environment.

Major versioning decisions:
* `python=3.11.5`. `torch`, `jax`, and `mujoco` all support it and there are major reported speed improvements over `python` 3.10.
* `cuda==11.8`. Both `torch` and `jax` support `cuda12`; however, they annoyingly support different minor versions which makes them [incompatible in the same environment](https://github.com/google/jax/issues/18032). Once this is resolved, we will upgrade to `cuda-12.2` or later. It seems most likely that `torch` will support `cuda-12.3` once they do upgrade, since that is the most recent release.

### Code Profiling
The majority of the profiling we do will be on JAX code. Here's a generic template for profiling code using `tensorboard` (you need the test dependencies):
```
# create the function you want to profile - we recommend jitting it, since this typically changes the profiling results
def fn_to_profile():
    ...

jit_fn = jit(fn_to_profile)

# choose a path to store the profiling results
with jax.profiler.trace("/dir/to/profiling/results"):
    jit_fn(inputs)
```
To view the profiling results, run
```
tensorboard --logdir=/dir/to/profiling/results --port <port>
```
where `--port` should be some open port like `8008`. In the top right dropdown menu which should say "Inactive," scroll down and select "Profile." Select the run you'd like to analyze and under tools, the most useful tab will usually be "trace_viewer."

Sometimes, we want to expose certain subroutines to the profiler. We can do so with the following:
```
# in one file
def fn():
    # stuff that we don't want to profile
    fn1()

    # stuff we do want to specifically profile
    with jax.named_scope("name_of_your_choice"):
        fn2()

# in another file containing the jitted function to profile
jit_fn = jit(fn)
with jax.profiler.trace("/dir/to/profiling/results"):
    jit_fn()
```
Now, the traced results will specifically show the time spent in `fn2` under the name you chose. Note that you can also use `jax.profiler.TraceAnnotation` or `jax.profiler.annotate_function()` instead, [as recommended](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profiling.html#adding-custom-trace-events).
